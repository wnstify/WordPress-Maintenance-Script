# WordPress-Maintenance-Script
This script is designed to automate the maintenance process for WordPress installations on a server. It verifies the integrity of WordPress core files, filters out common non-critical warnings, logs any discrepancies found, and sends a detailed report via email if any issues are detected. It's intended to help website administrators maintain the security and integrity of their WordPress sites efficiently.

## How It Works

The script performs the following actions:

- **Searches** for all WordPress installations in each user's directory on the server.
- **Verifies** the integrity of WordPress core files against the official WordPress version to ensure they haven't been altered or corrupted.
- **Ignores** common but non-critical warnings like missing or extra files that are known and often intentional.
- **Logs** any discrepancies or potential security issues found during the verification process.
- **Sends** a detailed HTML email report if issues are detected, highlighting the affected WordPress installations for further action.
- Automatically **runs every 12 hours** to ensure ongoing monitoring and security.
