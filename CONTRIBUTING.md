# Contributing to WordPress Maintenance Script

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the WordPress Maintenance Script. It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are greatly appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to this project, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into the script itself.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](https://github.com/wnstify/WordPress-Maintenance-Script/issues)as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g., implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise, you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's maintainers might not want to merge into the project.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the coding style [guidelines](STYLEGUIDE.md).
- Write tests for the new features and ensure the test suite passes.
- Write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

#### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
